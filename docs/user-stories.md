# State planning:

The state that got identified in the project is Location Search and this is the component that will be holding the state.
1.	Is it passed in from a parent via props?: No, it is not passed in from a parent via props.
2.	Does it remain unchanged over time?: No, it does not remain unchanged over time; its value may change based on user interactions, API calls, or other dynamic factors.
3.	Can it be computed from other state or props?: No, it cannot be computed from other state or props; it represents a standalone piece of data that is managed within the component.

## State is used in the following parts of the application:
####	Location Search:
- location: the location the user searched for 
#### Local Storage hook: sync list of locations state with local storage
-	Add location to Favourites
-	Remove from Favourites
#### Favourite Locations Page
-	favouriteLocations (uses hook): to display and remove locations
-	showModal: when we should render or hide the modal
-	locationToRemove: the location to remove from favourites
#### Place Details Page:
-	favouriteLocations (uses hook): to add to favourite locations
